## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- **Merged trades with the closest LOB snapshot** before execution.
- **Cleaned timestamps and converted timezones** to ensure consistency.
- **Created the PXA_filtered_merged.csv** after filtering and merging containing 4408 observations. Originally there were 25K orders and 4575 trades.

### 2️⃣ Market Microstructure Analysis
- **Bid-Ask Spread Analysis** 📊  
  - Measured L1-L10 spreads and liquidity conditions.
  - Plotted **spread changes over time** to detect liquidity shifts.

- **Mid-Price Calculations** 📈  
  - Compared **Simple Mid-Price, Volume-Weighted Mid-Price (VWMP), and Spread-Crossing VWMP**.
  - Evaluated accuracy by computing **MAE, MSE, RMSE, and correlation**.

- **Order Book Depth & Imbalance** 📉  
  - Computed **cumulative order depth** for bids and asks.
  - Measured **depth imbalance** to infer market pressure.

### 3️⃣ Trade Execution & Price Efficiency
- **Trade Price vs. Mid-Price**  
  - Analyzed **execution locations within the spread**.
  - Examined how **hidden orders impact execution quality**.

- **Trade Volume Aggregation**  
  - Grouped trades by timestamp to analyze **liquidity clustering**.

- **Regression Analysis**  
  - Fitted **linear models** to detect **trade price trends**.
  - Measured **correlation between L1 Mid-Price & trade execution prices**.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- **Implement real-time execution simulation** to test different order execution strategies.  
- **Apply machine learning models** to predict **spread tightening/widening**.  
- **Analyze impact of large institutional orders** on market liquidity.
